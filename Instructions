*If you just want to see what it looks like not make your own version just go to philysmart.netlify.app *
First download pheonix code in phcode.io or you can use the website version but I recommend you download it.
Next you need to make a Phoenix Folder or a Default Project.
Then you have to enter the code in index.html .
Now you have to create a new file called page2.html and enter the code in page2.html .
Since Phoenix Code has a mini website viewer on the right side you should see what it looks like, if you dont see it click a button that looks like a charger port.
Now you can see what my first html code would look like. If you know html you can add some more stuff.
When I make the new website for another game I will show you guys how to put your code into the internet.
